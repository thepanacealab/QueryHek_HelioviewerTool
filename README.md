Large scale solar event records and high-resolution full disk solar image dataset can fulfill different research purpose such as solar event classification, solar event future frame prediction, solar event tracking using cutting edge deep convolutional neural network techniques. This research works will serve the goal of getting in advance insights on different solar events which can have a direct impact on the Earth environment. 

A python script was developed to call the public API of HEK (Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase) to retrieve solar event records which were reported by several different institutes namely  NASA'S SDO (Solar Dynamic Observatory) Feature Finding Team, JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory), NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association), ROB (Royal Observatory of Belgium), SAO (Stanford, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory), LMSAL etc. This script can also be used to download and create a high-definition full disk solar image dataset from Helioviewer server.
